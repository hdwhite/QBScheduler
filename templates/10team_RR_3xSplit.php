		<p>Teams will initially play every other team once, for a nine-game round-robin. Afterwards, the teams will be placed into playoff brackets of 4, 3, and 3 teams, respectively. Each team will once again play a round-robin within their new bracket. All games will count towards final standing within each bracket. Finals in the top bracket will be played according to the following criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="finals2 finals3" style="display:none">If the first-place team has two or more wins than every other team, then that team wins the tournament outright without the need for a final.</li>
			<li class="finals1" style="display:none">If there is a single team with the best record, then that team wins the tournament outright without the need for a final.</li>
			<li class="finals1 finals2 finals3" style="display:none">If there is a two-way tie for first, those teams would play in a one-game final. If there is a tie of three or more teams, those teams will play a series of single-elimination matches, seeded by points per game.</li>
			<li class="finals2" style="display:none">If the first-place team has exactly one more win than the second-place team, then an advantaged final of up to two games will take place, with the second-place team needing to win twice but the first-place team needing to win only once. If there is a tie for second place, then entry into the finals will be broken by points per game.</li>
			<li class="finals3" style="display:none">If the first-place team has exactly one more win than the second-place team, then an advantaged final of up to two games will take place, with the second-place team needing to win twice but the first-place team needing to win only once.
